# Cancer Classifier Project
This project is part of a machine learning course focused on employing the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm to create a predictive model. Utilizing the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic) dataset, this model is designed to classify whether an individual has breast cancer or not. Our approach involves data processing, model training using the datasets, and extensive evaluation. The model's efficacy is determined through iterative testing with different `k` values, choosing the optimal model based on its accuracy.

## Features
- Model Training: Utilizes training and testing datasets to develop and improve the model, ensuring its performance.
- Performance Improvement: Different `k` parameters are tested to optimize the model's accuracy, indentifying the most effective value for precise classification.
- Performance Evaluation: Employs accuracy as the primary metric for evaluating the model's performance.

## Setup and installation
You can see the Jupyter Notebook [here](Cancer%20Classifier.ipynb) or can install it locally using the next steps:

**Prerequisite**: This project requires Jupyter Notebook to be installed. If you do not have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can find installation instructions at the [documentation](https://jupyter.org).

To set up and show the notebook locally, follow these steps:
1. Run the following command in your terminal to clone the project repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Joel-Milla/Cancer_Classifier.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned project directory and launch Jupyter Notebook to access the .ipynb files.
3. Run cells sequentially using `Shift + Enter`.
